Working on a new branch.

I might use Django for the project.

Figuring out how to organise my project.

Currently watching some tutorials. Found some good tutorials.

Currently working on the user flows.

I am going to get started on the project structure.

Created a new branch to create the project structure.

Mon 22th Jan 24- I am in pain today so wasn't able to get anything done.

Still working through the Django tutorial.
